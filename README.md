# ICCP

ICCP is an International Course in Computational Physics
for physics Students from Delft University of technology. The first project is Molecular Dynamics. Here we have to simulate the behaviour of a noble gas.
The Codes for this project can be found in the folder Molecular dynamics in file ArgonSandbox_temp.
The Callaborator: Rick Vink

The second project is a quantum mechanics. Here we analyze the behaviour of 
bringing two hydrogen atoms close to each other. We solve the dissocaition energy for the hydrogen molecule with the quantum variatioanl method. This is done with a a paticular method of the Monte Carlo simulation also known as the metropolis walker. The algoritms are written in C++ and are located in the quantum mechanics folder (includes and sources).
Collaborator: Mario Gely
