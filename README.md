# ICCP

ICCP stands for International Course in Computational Physics
for physics Students from Delft University of technology. The first project is Molecular Dynamics. Here we have to simulate the
behaviour of a noble gas.
The Codes for this project can be found in the folder Molecular dynamics in file ArgonSandbox_temp.
The Callaborator: Rick Vink

The second project is a quantum mechanics. Here we analyze the behaviour of 
bringing two hydrogen atoms close to each other. This project is still under construction and more information 
will follow in coming week.
Collaborator: Mario Gely
